/*
A table called student is created with the following DDL command:

create table student (id int, name varchar(20),physics int, maths int, chemistry int);

Write the Java code using JDBC APIs to insert two student records with the following values:
id as 1, name as "Student1", physics as 85, maths as 95 and chemistry as 89.
id as 2, name as "Student2", physics as 91, maths as 96 and chemistry as 93.

IMPORTANT:
	1. Place your code inside the execute method. You need not code/implement the main method.
	2. DO NOT close the Database Connection conn in your code.
