/*
The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must compress the integer N by concatenating the digital sum of every two consecutive digits. Then the program must print the modified value of N as the output.

Boundary Condition(s): 10 <= N <= 10^9

Input Format:

	The first line contains the value of N.

Output Format:

	The first line contains the modified value of N.

Example Input/Output 1:

	Input:

		208914

	Output: 

		28815

	Explanation:

		The digital sum of 2 and 0 is 2 The digital sum of 0 and 8 is 8

		The digital sum of 8 and 9 is 8

		The digital sum of 9 and 1 is 1 The digital sum of 1 and 4 is 5 Hence the output is 28815

Example Input/Output 2: 
	Input 

		1234

	Output:Â 

		357
