'''
The program accepts N integers and prints the integers which are having at least three distinct digits. If there is no such integer, the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
	1 <= N <= 100
	100 <= Each integer value <= 10^8

Input Format:
	The first line contains N.
	The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
	The first line contains the integers which are having at least three distinct digits separated by a space or -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
	Input:
		5
		488 978 1432 151 5070
	Output:
		978 1432 5070
	Explanation:
		The integer 488 contains 2 distinct digits. 
		The integer 978 contains 3 distinct digits. 
		The integer 1432 contains 4 distinct digits. 
		The integer 151 contains 2 distinct digits. 
		The integer 5070 contains 3 distinct digits. 
		Hence the output is 978 1432 5070

Example Input/Output 2:
	Input:
		4
		100 474 255 666
	Output: 
		-1
