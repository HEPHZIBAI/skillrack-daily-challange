You must implement the function addWithPrevious(int arr[], int N) which accepts an integer array arr and its size N as the input. The function must modify the integer array arr by replacing each integer X by adding with its previous integer. The first integer in the array arr has no integers on its left side, so it remains the same.

Example Input/Output 1:
	Input:
		5
		10 20 30 40 50
	Output:
		Array: 10 30 50 70 90
	Explanation:
		The first integer in the arrav has no integers on its left side
		The previous integer of 20 is 10. So their sum 30 (20+10) is replaced.
		The previous integer of 30 is 20. So their sum 50 (30+20) is replaced.
		The previous integer of 40 is 30. So their sum 70 (40+30) is replaced.
		The previous integer of 50 is 40. So their sum 90 (50+40) is replaced.
		Now the array becomes 10 30 50 70 90.

Example Input/Output 2:
	Input:
		4
		1 2 3 4
	Output: 
		Array: 1 3 5 7
